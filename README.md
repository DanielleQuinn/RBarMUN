# RBar at Memorial University

RBar is a weekly scientific programming study group where we tackle R issues in a cooperative group setting. We welcome people from all disciplines, across all experience and skill levels, including undergraduates, graduates, faculty, and researchers!

- Outlets are limited at the location so please try to come with a charged computer.  
- Please note the Breezeway is a student bar, so this is a 19+ event. Please bring a valid form of ID.  

> Do you have a suggestion for a future event? Would you like to host a tutorial, workshop, or demonstration? Are you willing to share a piece of code that you think might be useful to others, or a solution to a common problem? Let us know on our [facebook page](https://www.facebook.com/RBarMUN/)! Also follow us on Twitter [@RBarMUN](https://twitter.com/RBarMUN) and/or join our [Slack](https://rbar-mun.slack.com/signup) group!
