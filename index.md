# RBar at Memorial University


RBar is a weekly scientific programming study group where we tackle R issues in a cooperative group setting. We welcome people from all disciplines, across all experience and skill levels, including undergraduates, graduates, faculty, and researchers!

- Outlets are limited at the location so please try to come with a charged computer.  
- Please note the Breezeway is a student bar, so this is a 19+ event. Please bring a valid form of ID.  

> Do you have a suggestion for a future event? Would you like to host a tutorial, workshop, or demonstration? Are you willing to share a piece of code that you think might be useful to others, or a solution to a common problem? Let us know! Follow us on Twitter [@RBarMUN](https://twitter.com/RBarMUN) and/or join our [Slack](https://rbar-mun.slack.com/signup) group!

This event is all about sharing the tips and tricks you find most useful, demonstrating the interesting things R can do, and learning from each other!  

### Introduction to Linear Mixed Effect Models in R  
*November 25, 2019*  
*Location:* The Breezeway, 5:30 - 6:00  
*Instructor:* Sara SauvÃ©  
*Target Audience:* Intermediate  
*Suggested Prerequisites:* Basic R / RStudio  

Linear mixed models are an extension of simple linear models to allow both fixed and random effects, and are particularly used when there is non independence in the data, such as arises from a hierarchical structure. This is a technique commonly used in ecology and across disciplines, so take this fantastic opportunity to skill-up! Tutorial materials can be found [here](https://github.com/sarahsauve/MUN_RBar_lme4Tutorial).
